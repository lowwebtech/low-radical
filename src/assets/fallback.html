  </h1>

  <p>
    Amazon is the first GAFAM services that low—radical aims to boycott. Why? Here are some explainations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Amazon is largely powered by fossil fuels, more than any other big tech company.
    </li>
    <li>
      Amazon exploits workers, fights unions and fights tax laws that would support local economies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Amazon creates catastrophic packaging waste and destroys millions of unsold items to free spaces in its warehouses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Amazon have created a huge monopoly on online commerce and infrastructures for selling on the internet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unfair competition, sales at a loss, amazon prime (highly polluting video services), always hungry for more consumption which lead to more destruction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optimization of business and profits for a minority rather than distribution, improvement of quality and reduction of working time (1 Amazon job usually destroys 2-3 jobs).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To fight against Amazon is to boycott its business of online commerce and the sale of its AWS infrastructure.
