    </h1>

    <p>
      Amazon is the first GAFAM services that low—radical aims to boycott. Why?
      Here are some explainations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Amazon is largely powered by fossil fuels, more than any other big tech
        company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Amazon exploits workers, fights unions and fights tax laws that would
        support local economies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Amazon creates catastrophic packaging waste and destroys millions of
        unsold items to free spaces in its warehouses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Amazon is creating a huge monopoly on online commerce and the
        infrastructure for selling on the internet
      </li>
      <li>
        Amazon tracks, creates, optimizes, analyzes all our needs to make us
        consume as much as possible at the lowest price whatever the
        consequences, especially for employment (1 Amazon job destroys 2-3 jobs)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To fight against Amazon is to boycott its business of online commerce and
      the sale of its AWS infrastructure.
