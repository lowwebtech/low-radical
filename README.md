# Low—radical

Cette extension lutte contre Amazon. Elle bloque les sites e-commerce d'Amazon, dégrade les sites appartenants à Amazon ou limite l'utilisation des serveurs AWS.

## Why ?

Amazon is the first GAFAM services that Low—radical aims to boycott. Why? Here are some explainations:

- Amazon is largely powered by fossil fuels, more than any other big tech company.
- Amazon exploits workers, fights unions and fights tax laws that would support local economies.
- Amazon creates catastrophic packaging waste and destroys millions of unsold items to free spaces in its warehouses.
- Amazon is creating a huge monopoly on online commerce and the infrastructure for selling on the internet
- Unfair competition, sale at a loss, day one == always more, amazon prime (sale of film to capture the consumer), always more consumption, globalization 2.0
- optimization of business and profits for a minority rather than distribution, improvement of quality and reduction of working time (1 Amazon job destroys 2-3 jobs)


## How ?

To fight against Amazon is to attack your business, and your business is online commerce and the sale of your AWS infrastructure.

So here's what the extension does:
- blocks Amazon e-commerce sites, a message will be displayed instead. It is therefore no longer possible to buy on Amazon when the extension is activated. This limits online sales through Amazon.
- blocks unnecessary files of type: font, media (video / sound), iframe and object for all Amazon sites as well as on the main Amazon CDNs (cloudfront.net, amazonaws.com ...). This limits the use of AWS servers powered by fossil energy.
- a 'gray level' filter is applied to all of the sites owned by Amazon, finally the sites that are not blocked :)
- displays a 'coal' or 'dirt' badge on the extension icon when it detects that the site you are visiting is using AWS. This lets you know that this site emits a little more CO2.
- replace all occurrences of 'Jeff Bezos' with what you want as 'Jeff Devil Bezos'.
